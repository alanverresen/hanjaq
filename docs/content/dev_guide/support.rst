Supported Versions of Python
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which Versions?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project actively supports the following versions of Python:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guiding Principles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following principles are used to determine which versions of Python are
to be supported:

* every major release of Python that is still maintained should be supported
* support should be added for final release candidates of a new major release
* support may be dropped within the last 12 months of maintenance

What Does Support Entail?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a specific version of Python is supported, we promise to do everything
that is possible to make things work like expected for that version of Python.
This means that code doesn't necessarily break for any version that is not
being actively supported, but if it does break, we will not make any attempts
to fix it.
